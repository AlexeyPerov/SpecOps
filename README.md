# SpecOps

Desktop text and Markdown editor built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Open local files in tabs, edit with CodeMirror, preview Markdown, compare unsaved changes, and restore your session across restarts.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable toolchain, required by Tauri)

## Development

From the `app/` directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and opens the desktop app. Type-check the frontend with:

```sh
npm run check
```

### Unit tests

From the `app/` directory:

```sh
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode while developing:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

Tests live next to source as `*.test.ts` files under `app/src/`. Rust backend tests run from `app/src-tauri/`:

```sh
cargo test
```

See `specs/unit-tests.md` for the full catalog and agent execution plan.

If port **1430** is already in use (Vite is pinned to that port), free it and retry:

```sh
kill "$(lsof -t -iTCP:1430 -sTCP:LISTEN)"
npm run tauri dev
```

## Build

From the `app/` directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

Installers and bundles are written to `app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

On macOS, CI builds a universal binary when you push a semver tag (`v1.0.0`).
